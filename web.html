Our process keeps those people involved, engaged and informed throughout design, build and the life of your project.</p>  <p id="work"><strong>Our work has a strong user focus.</strong> In many ways, your website or app is for them, so we design for them. Understanding where, how, and why users will interact with your content, and what messaging we want to deliver, is critical. It’s what makes us good at what we do.</p>  <p id="build"><strong>We’ve been building websites and apps for years.</strong> By looking at what functionality you need, how much you want to spend, and how you want to use the website, we establish which back-end or content management system is most suitable for you. We’re platform agnostic, for you.</p>  <img src="images/web.png" alt="Computer and Paper"></section><section class="app">  <p>Talk to us today about the work we've done, and your next project.</p>  <a href="letstalk.html"><button class="button" type="submit">Talk to us</button></a></section><footer>  <ul class="footer-nav">    <li><a href="digitalstrategy.html">Digital Strategy</a></li>    <li><a href="#">Website & Apps</a></li>    <li class="symbol"><a href="modules.html"><img src="images/symbol.png" alt="Alchemy Digital"></a></li>    <li><a href="digitalmarketing.html">Digital Marketing</a></li>    <li><a href="letstalk.html">Work with us</a></li>  </ul>  <p>Thank you for visiting.    We hope to hear from you.</p></footer></body></html>
